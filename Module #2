 For my assignment I had to evaluate some code given to me and fix the output. The following is the code I was given to run in RStudio:

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

myMean <- function(assignment2) {

  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))

}

myMean(assignment2)

However, when this code was run, the following was the output error:\

Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'assignment' not found

This error pops up because there is nothing in the code labeled "assignment". However, the vector is listed/named "assignment2". However, if you correct the naming error and run the following code:

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

myMean <- function(assignment2) {

  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))

}

myMean(assignment2)

You will recieve the following error:

Error in myMean(assignment2) : object 'someData' not found

This code means nothing has been defined as "someData" therefore the code doens't know what you are trying to reference.

A simple way to fix this code is to simply run: mean(assignment2). However, if we want it to be labeled as "myMean" we could write the following code:

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)



myMean <- mean(assignment2)



myMean

The following is the output we would recieve:

> myMean
[1] 19.25

This is a sweet and simple assignment that teaches us to make sure we're keeping our labels/names uniform, otherwise they can mess up an entire program!
